# RenderFarm
A web  server  elastic  cluster  that  renders  3D  images  on-demand by executing a ray-tracing algorithm (serving as demonstrator of CPU-intensive processing). The system will receive a stream of web requests.  Each request is for the rendering of a rectangle (of specific variable size) that is part of a full, much larger scene.
